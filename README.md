# DMV

This application allow users to create a person with a first and last name by visiting the route "/person/new". Upon creation, the person is added to the database and their profile page, fitted with their first and last name. Next, by visiting "/license/new", users can create a driver's license and attach that license to the person they created. This is defined as a One-to-One relationship, therefore a particular person can only have one driver's license, and a driver's license can only belong to one person. Upon creating the driver's license, users are again presented with a profile page, but this time the profile page belongs to the person that was defined as the owner of the newly created driver's license. However, this page has been updated and now presents the properties of the driver's license.
